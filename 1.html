  </p><p style="margin-top:30px;">While the terms ‘performance’ and
    ‘performance art’ only became widely used in the 1970s,
    the history of performance in the visual arts is often traced back to
    futurist productions and dada cabarets of the 1910s.
  <br>
  Throughout the twentieth century performance was often seen
  as a non-traditional way of making art. Live-ness,
  physical movement and impermanence offered artists
  alternatives to the static permanence of painting and sculpture.
  <br>
  In the post-war period performance became aligned with conceptual art,
  because of its often immaterial nature.</p>
